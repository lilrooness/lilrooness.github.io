			<p>My wife likes to tell me that I'm a Spring person. I always start doing something in spring, whether that's picking up an old project from a previous year, or starting a new one. There's something about the sunshine and fresh air that fills me with creative energy. Or maybe it's just a rebound after the brutally dark Icelandic winters.</p>


			<p>This blogg, like so many other projects I start during this season, will probably be picked up and dropped over and over again. But overtime, I hope this will become a garden of my thoughts. Even if I end up being the only one who reads it.</p>
